# Elixir for Programmers, 2002 Edition
## Example Project

This is the updated project that we use throughout the second version of the
_Elixir for Programmers_ course. 

You might be wondering why there's nothing here. It's because the code is developed
in successive branches. As you go through the course, you'll come across signposts
which tell you the branch that contains the corresponding code.

Enjoy!

Dave
